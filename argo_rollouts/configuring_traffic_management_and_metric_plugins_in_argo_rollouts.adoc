toc::[]

Argo Rollouts supports configuring traffic management and metric plugins directly through the `RolloutManager` Custom Resource (CR). The native support for these plugins in Argo Rollouts eliminates the need to modify the config map manually, ensuring a consistent configuration across the system. As a result, Argo Rollouts no longer preserves user-defined plugins in the config map. Instead, it only applies to the plugins specified within the `RolloutManager` CR. By managing plugins directly within the `RolloutManager` CR, you can do the following:

* Centralize plugin configuration control.
* Avoid conflicts between the `RolloutManager` CR and config map.
* Simplify plugin management by allowing easy addition, removal, or modification of plugins without editing the config map directly.

The traffic management plugin controls how traffic routes between different versions of your application during a rollout, while the metric plugin collects and evaluates metrics to determine the success or failure of a rollout.
