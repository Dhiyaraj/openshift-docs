Event processing usually completes within a short time frame, such as a few minutes. This ensures that the HTTP connection remains open and the service does not scale down prematurely.

Maintaining long-running connections increases the risk of failure, potentially leading to processing restarts and repeated request retries.

You can use JobSink to support long-running asynchronous jobs and tasks using the full Kubernetes `batch/v1` Job resource and features and Kubernetes job queuing systems such as Kueue.
