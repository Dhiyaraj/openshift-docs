You can configure event delivery parameters that are applied in cases where an event fails to be delivered to an event sink. Different channel and broker types have their own behavior patterns that are followed for event delivery.

Configuring event delivery parameters, including a dead letter sink, ensures that any events that fail to be delivered to an event sink are retried. Otherwise, undelivered events are dropped.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If an event is successfully delivered to a channel or broker receiver for Apache Kafka, the receiver responds with a `202` status code, which means that the event has been safely stored inside a Kafka topic and is not lost. If the receiver responds with any other status code, the event is not safely stored, and steps must be taken by the user to resolve the issue.
