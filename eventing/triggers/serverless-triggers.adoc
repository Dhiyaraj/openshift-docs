Triggers are an essential component in Knative Eventing that connect specific event sources to subscriber services based on defined filters. By creating a Trigger, you can dynamically manage how events are routed within your system, ensuring they reach the appropriate destination based on your business logic.

//If you are using a Knative broker for Apache Kafka, you can configure the delivery order of events from triggers to event sinks. See xref:../../eventing/triggers/serverless-triggers.adoc#trigger-event-delivery-config_serverless-triggers[Configuring event delivery ordering for triggers].
