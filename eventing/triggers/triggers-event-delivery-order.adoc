In Knative Eventing, the delivery order of events plays a critical role in ensuring messages are processed according to application requirements. When using a Kafka broker, you can specify whether events should be delivered in order or without strict ordering. By configuring the delivery order, you can optimize event handling for use cases that require sequential processing or prioritize performance for unordered delivery.
