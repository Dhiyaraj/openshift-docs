== Prerequisites

* You have access to the {OCP} web console.
* You are logged in as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You are logged in to the {OCP} cluster as an administrator.
* Your cluster has the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/overview/cluster-capabilities.html#marketplace-operator_cluster-capabilities[Marketplace capability] enabled or the Red Hat Operator catalog source configured manually.

[WARNING]
====
If you have already installed the Community version of the Argo CD Operator, remove the Argo CD Community Operator before you install the {gitops-title} Operator.
====

This guide explains how to install the {gitops-title} Operator to an {OCP} cluster and log in to the Argo CD instance.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `latest` channel enables installation of the most recent stable version of the {gitops-title} Operator. Currently, it is the default channel for installing the {gitops-title} Operator.

To install a specific version of the {gitops-title} Operator, cluster administrators can use the corresponding `gitops-<version>` channel. For example, to install the {gitops-title} Operator version 1.8.x, you can use the `gitops-1.8` channel.
