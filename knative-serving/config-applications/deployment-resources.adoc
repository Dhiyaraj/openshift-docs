In Knative Serving, the `config-deployment` config map contains settings that determine how Kubernetes `Deployment` resources are configured for Knative services. In {ServerlessProductName} Serving, you can configure these settings in the `deployment` section of your `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR).

You can use the `deployment` section to configure the following:

* Tag resolution
* Runtime environments
* Progress deadlines

//Skipping tag resolution

//Configuring selectable RuntimeClassName

//Progress deadline

//Configuring progress deadline
