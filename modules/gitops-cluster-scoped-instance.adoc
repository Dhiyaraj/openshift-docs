= Cluster-scoped instance 

A cluster-scoped instance is intended to deploy and manage resources across a cluster.

[NOTE]
====
If you intend to use the _Applications in any namespace_ feature, choose the mode of the Argo CD instance scope as cluster-scoped instance.
====

Cluster-scoped instances have access to cluster-level resources and thus are typically, but not always, used for cluster configuration. You can choose to elevate certain namespace-scoped Argo CD instances to become cluster-scoped. To elevate the instances, you must modify the `Subscription` resource of the {gitops-shortname} Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ensure you give careful consideration while elevating instances.
* Do not elevate instances that are self-managed by application delivery teams. Elevating such instances would be a severe security risk to the cluster because this action makes users of self-managed instances cluster administrators, and gives them full control over the permissions. 
====

Much care must be taken when setting up multitenancy configuration within Argo CD. For example, in a use case where cluster administrators want to set up an Argo CD instance that is shared among multiple application delivery teams and is managed by the cluster administrators, having a custom cluster-scoped instance might be what you need.

.How does this method work?

To prevent users from deploying Argo CD instances with `cluster-admin` privileges, you must identify the namespaces with cluster privileges by using the `ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES` environment variable in the `Subscription` resource. 

Because non-cluster administrators do not have access to the `Subscription` resource, they cannot elevate the privileges of their instance and bypass cluster security.

When an instance is designated as cluster-scoped, the Operator automatically creates a set of cluster role and cluster role bindings for the Argo CD Application Controller and server service accounts in that namespace. This default role is not intended to be the equivalent of the standard `cluster-admin` role. It is given a much smaller set of permissions. These permissions can be extended by creating additional cluster roles or cluster role bindings as needed.
