= Default cluster-scoped instance 

After you install the {gitops-shortname} Operator, by default, it instantiates a cluster-scoped instance in the `openshift-gitops` namespace. This instance is set up in a very opinionated way and is intended to allow cluster administrators to manage certain cluster configuration resources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Do not use the default cluster-scoped instance for anything else, such as application delivery. 
* Do not grant permission to users who do not have `cluster-admin` roles to access the default cluster-scoped instance.
====

The default instance does not have full `cluster-admin` privileges. It has read access to all resources in the cluster, but it can only deploy a limited set of resources.

[NOTE]
====
Use the default Argo CD instance in the `openshift-gitops` namespace for cluster configuration and delegate tenant use cases to one or many separate instances in other namespaces.
