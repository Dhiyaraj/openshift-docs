== Bug fixes
* Before this update, Loki automatically tried to guess the log level of log messages, which caused confusion because the collector already does this, and Loki and the collector would sometimes come to different results. With this update, the automatic log level discovery in Loki is disabled. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6322[LOG-6322].
