= Logging 5.9.11

This release includes link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:1227[RHSA-2025:1227].

[id="openshift-logging-5-9-11-enhancements_{context}"]
== Enhancements
* This enhancement adds `OTel` semantic stream labels to the `lokiStack` output so that you can query logs by using both `ViaQ` and `OTel` stream labels. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6581[LOG-6581])

[id="logging-release-notes-5-9-11-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug Fixes
* Before this update, the collector container mounted all log sources. With this update, it mounts only the defined input sources. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5691[LOG-5691])

* Before this update, fluentd ignored the `no_proxy` setting when using the HTTP output. With this update, the `no_proxy` setting is picked up correctly.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6586[LOG-6586])

* Before this update, clicking on "more logs" from the pod detail view triggered a false permission error due to a missing namespace parameter required for authorization. With this update, clicking "more logs" includes the namespace parameter, preventing the permission error and allowing access to more logs.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6645[LOG-6645])

* Before this update, specifying `syslog.addLogSource` added `namespace_name`, `container_name`, and `pod_name` to the messages of non-container logs. With this update, only container logs will include `namespace_name`, `container_name`, and `pod_name` in their messages when `syslog.addLogSource` is set.
