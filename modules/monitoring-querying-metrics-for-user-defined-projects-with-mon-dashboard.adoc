= Querying metrics for user-defined projects with the {product-title} web console

// The following section will be included in the developer section, hence there is no need to include "developer" in the title

You can use the {product-title} metrics query browser to run Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries to examine metrics visualized on a plot. This functionality provides information about any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

As a developer, you must specify a project name when querying metrics. You must have the required privileges to view metrics for the selected project.

In the *Developer* perspective, the Metrics UI includes some predefined CPU, memory, bandwidth, and network packet queries for the selected project. You can also run custom Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries for CPU, memory, bandwidth, network packet and application metrics for the project.

[NOTE]
====
Developers can only use the *Developer* perspective and not the *Administrator* perspective. As a developer, you can only query metrics for one project at a time.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a developer or as a user with view permissions for the project that you are viewing metrics for.
* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have deployed a service in a user-defined project.
* You have created a `ServiceMonitor` custom resource definition (CRD) for the service to define how the service is monitored.

.Procedure

. In the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console, go to *Observe* -> *Metrics*.

. Select the project that you want to view metrics for from the *Project:* list.

. Select a query from the *Select query* list, or create a custom PromQL query based on the selected query by clicking *Show PromQL*. The metrics from the queries are visualized on the plot.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the *Developer* perspective, you can only run one query at a time.
====

. Explore the visualized metrics by performing any of the following actions:
