== Fixed issues

The following section highlights fixed issues in {builds-shortname} 1.2.1.

* Before this update, when you installed {builds-shortname} without installing OpenShift Pipelines, the {builds-shortname} attempted to deploy OpenShift Pipelines and enable Pipelines controllers. {builds-shortname} incorrectly configured OpenShift Pipelines and failed to deploy the controllers. With this update, {builds-shortname} creates a valid `TektonConfig` custom resource and correctly deploys the Pipelines controllers.

* Before this update, when you tried to run builds using {builds-title} installed on ARM64, IBM Power(R), or IBM Z(R) worker node CPU architectures, the build would fail because images were based on AMD64 platform only. Now, the AMD64 images are replaced with a `multi-arch` image in `buildah` and `source-to-image` build strategies, therefore you can run builds on all the architectures.

* Before this update, when you enabled cluster monitoring in the `openshift-builds` namespace, the `TargetDown` alert was received on the Shared Resources Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver `ServiceMonitor` resource due to an incorrect server name address. With this update, the server name is updated to the correct address in the Shared Resources CSI Driver `ServiceMonitor` resource and the `TargetDown` alert is no longer triggered.
