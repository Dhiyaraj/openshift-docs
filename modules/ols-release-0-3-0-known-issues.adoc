The following issues are identified with {ols-official} 0.3.0:

* If the {ols-long} Operator is installed in a namespace other than `openshift-lightspeed`, the Operator cannot reconcile the secret used to authenticate the Large Language Model (LLM) provider. 
+
Workaround: The LLM provider secret must be created before the `OLSConfig` custom resource is created. Then, the Operator can reconcile the secret. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1426[OLS-1426].
