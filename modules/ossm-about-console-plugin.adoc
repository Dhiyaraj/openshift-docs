The {SMPlugin} is an extension to {ocp-product-title} web console that provides visibility into your {SMProductShortName}.

[WARNING]
====
The {SMPluginShort} supports only one Kiali instance, regardless of its project access scope.
====

The {SMPluginShort} provides a new category, *{SMProductShortName}*, in the main {ocp-product-title} web console navigation with the following menu options:

Overview:: Provides a summary of your mesh, displayed as cards that represent the namespaces in the mesh.

Traffic Graph:: Provides a full topology view of your mesh, represented by nodes and edges. Each node represents a component of the mesh and each edge represents traffic flowing through the mesh between components.

{istio} config:: Provides a list of all {istio} configuration files in your mesh, with a column that provides a quick way to know if the configuration for each resource is valid.

Mesh:: Provides detailed information about the {istio} infrastructure status. It shows an infrastructure topology view with core and add-on components, their health, and how they are connected to each other.

In the web console *Workloads* details page, the {SMPluginShort} adds a *{SMProductShortName}* tab that has the following subtabs:

Overview:: Shows a summary of the selected workload, including a localized topology graph showing the workload with all inbound and outbound edges and nodes.

Traffic:: Shows information about all inbound and outbound traffic to the workload.

Logs:: Shows the logs for the workload's containers. You can see container logs individually ordered by log time and how the Envoy sidecar proxy logs relate to your workload's application logs. You can enable the tracing span integration, which allows you to see which logs correspond to trace spans.

Metrics:: Shows inbound and outbound metric graphs in the corresponding subtabs. All the workload metrics are here, providing a detailed view of the performance of your workload. You can enable the tracing span integration, which allows you to see which spans occurred at the same time as the metrics. With the span marker in the graph, you can see the specific spans associated with that timeframe.

Traces:: Provides a chart showing the trace spans collected over the given timeframe. The trace spans show the most low-level detail within your workload application. The trace details further show heatmaps that provide a comparison of one span in relation to other requests and spans in the same timeframe.

Envoy:: Shows information about the Envoy sidecar configuration.

In the web console *Networking* details page, the {SMPluginShort} adds a *{SMProductShortName}* tab similar to the *Workloads* details page.

In the web console *Projects* details page, the {SMPluginShort} adds a *{SMProductShortName}* tab that provides traffic graph information about that project. It is the same information shown in the *Traffic Graph* page but specific to that project.
