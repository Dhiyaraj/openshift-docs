= About deploying multiple control planes

To configure a cluster to host two control planes, set up separate {istio} resources with unique names in independent {istio} system namespaces. Assign a unique revision name to each {istio} resource to identify the control planes, workloads, or namespaces it manages. Apply these revision names using injection or `istio.io/rev` labels to specify which control plane injects the sidecar proxy into application pods.

Each `{istio}` resource must also configure discovery selectors to specify which namespaces the {istio} control plane observes. Only namespaces with labels that match the configured discovery selectors can join the mesh. Additionally, discovery selectors determine which control plane creates the `istio-ca-root-cert` config map in each namespace, which is used to encrypt traffic between services with mutual TLS within each mesh.

When adding an additional {istio} control plane to a cluster with an existing control plane, ensure that the existing `{istio}` instance has discovery selectors configured to avoid overlapping with the new control plane.

[NOTE]
====
Only one `IstioCNI` resource is shared by all control planes in a cluster, and you must update this resource independent of other cluster resources.
