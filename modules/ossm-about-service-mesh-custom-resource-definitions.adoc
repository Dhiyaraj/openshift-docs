= About Service Mesh custom resource definitions

Installing the {SMProductName} Operator also installs custom resource definitions (CRD) that administrators can use to configure {istio} for {SMProductShortName} installations. The {olm-first} installs two categories of CRDs: {sail-operator} CRDs and {istio} CRDs.

{sail-operator} CRDs define custom resources for installing and maintaining the {istio} components required to operate a service mesh. These custom resources belong to the `sailoperator.io` API group and include the `Istio`, `IstioRevision`, `IstioCNI`, and `ZTunnel` resource kinds. For more information on how to configure these resources, see the `sailoperator.io` link:https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/sail-operator/blob/main/docs/api-reference/sailoperator.io.md[API reference] documentation.

{istio} CRDs are associated with mesh configuration and service management. These CRDs define custom resources in several `istio.io` API groups, such as `networking.istio.io` and `security.istio.io`. The CRDs also include various resource kinds, such as `AuthorizationPolicy`, `DestinationRule`, and `VirtualService`, that administrators use to configure a service mesh.
