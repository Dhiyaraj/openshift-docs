= About sidecar injection

Sidecar injection is enabled using labels at the namespace or pod level. These labels also indicate the specific control plane managing the proxy. When you apply a valid injection label to the pod template defined in a deployment, any new pods created by that deployment automatically receive a sidecar. Similarly, applying a pod injection label at the namespace level ensures any new pods in that namespace include a sidecar.

[NOTE]
====
Injection happens at pod creation through an admission controller, so changes appear on individual pods rather than the deployment resources. To confirm sidecar injection, check the pod details directly using `oc describe`, where you can see the injected {istio} proxy container.
