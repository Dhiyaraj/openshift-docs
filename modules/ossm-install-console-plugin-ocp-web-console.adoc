= Installing {SMPluginShort} by using the {ocp-product-title} web console

You can install the {SMPlugin} by using the {ocp-product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have the administrator access to the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* You have installed the {SMProduct} (OSSM).
* You have installed the `{istio}` control plane from OSSM 3.0.
* You have installed the {KialiServer} 2.4.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Installed Operators*.

. Click *{KialiProduct}*.

. Click *Create instance* on the *{SMProductName} Console* tile. You can also click *Create OSSMConsole* button under the *{SMProduct} Console* tab.

. Use the *Create OSSMConsole* form to create an instance of the `OSSMConsole` custom resource (CR). *Name* and *Version* are the required fields.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Version* field must match with the `spec.version` field in your Kiali custom resource (CR). If *Version* value is the string `default`, the Kiali Operator installs {ossmc-full} (OSSMC) with the same version as the operator. The `spec.version` field requires the `v` prefix in the version number. The version number must only include the major and minor version numbers (not the patch number); for example: `v1.73`.
====

. Click *Create*.

.Verification

. Wait until the web console notifies you that the {SMPluginShort} is installed and prompts you to refresh.

. Verify that the *{SMProductShortName}* category is added in the main {ocp-product-title} web console navigation.
