//Start of an overall Migrating section.
//Section is most likely to be reworked/restructured with OSSM 2 to OSSM 3 migration guides for GA. Unknown how many migration guides there are at this time (11/11/2024). It would be beneficial to be able to link from differences to the relevent migration guide so that users A) understand the change, esp significant changes like new operator, installing tracing and Kiali separately, gateways, etc.

= Differences between OpenShift Service Mesh 2 and OpenShift Service Mesh 3

If you are a current {SMProductName} user, there are a number of important differences you need to understand between {SMProduct} 2 and {SMProduct} 3 before you migrate, including the following:

* A new Operator
* Integrations like Observability and Kiali are installed separately
* New resources: `Istio` and `IstioCNI`
* Scoping of a mesh with `discoverySelectors` and labels
* New considerations for sidecar injection
* Support for multiple control planes
* Independently managed gateways
* Explicit Istio OpenShift route creation
* Canary upgrades
* Support for Istio multi-cluster topologies
* Support for Istioctl
* Change to Kubernetes network policy management
* Transport layer security (TLS) configuration change

You must be using {SMProduct} 2.6 to migrate to {SMProduct} 3.
