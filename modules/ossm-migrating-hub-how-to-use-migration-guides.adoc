== Using the migration guides

The migration guides are designed to help you move from {SMProduct} {SMv2Version} to {SMProduct} 3.0, based on your deployment model:

* Mulitenant
* Mulitenant with cert-manager
* Cluster-wide
* Cluster-wide with cert-manager

The migration guides use the `bookinfo` application as an example for demonstrations purposes.

You can also migrate gateways.
