= Recommendations for migrating

Consider the following recommendations to limit the risk of misconfigurations or possible conflicts:

* If you have automated updates configured in the {ocp-product-title} web console, change them to **Manual**. By switching to manual updates, you can prevent updates to the {SMProduct} 2 Operator and control planes during your migration.

* Keep the amount of the service mesh configuration changes, such as changes for traffic management or security or adding new workloads or gateways, to a minimum during the migration.

[NOTE]
====
If you need to add a new workload namespace during the migration, it must be managed by the {SMProduct} 3 control plane and labeled with `maistra.io/ignore-namespace: "true"` to avoid conflicts between the {SMProduct} 3 control plane and the {SMProduct} 2 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.
====

* Finish the migration without unnecessary delays.
