= Using the cert-manager tool with your deployment

You must check if your deployment uses the cert-manager tool. If you are using the cert-manager tool with {SMProduct} 2, you must perform additional configurations before you can start migrating your deployments and workloads.

.Procedure

. Use one of the following ways to check if you are using the cert-manager tool with your deployment:

.. Inspect your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to verify that the `spec.security.certificateAuthority.type` parameter is set to `cert-manager`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  ...
  security:
    certificateAuthority:
      cert-manager:
        address: cert-manager-istio-csr.istio-system.svc:443
      type: cert-manager
    dataPlane:
      mtls: true
    identity:
      type: ThirdParty
    manageNetworkPolicy: false
----

.. Run the following command to verify that the `spec.security.certificateAuthority.type` parameter is set to `cert-manager`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
oc get smcp <smcp-name> -n <smcp-namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.security.certificateAuthority.type}'
