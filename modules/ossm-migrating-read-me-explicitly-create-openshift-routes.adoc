//Start of an overall Migrating section.
//Section is most likely to be reworked/restructured with OSSM 2 to OSSM 3 migration guides for GA. Unknown how many migration guides there are at this time (11/11/2024). It would be beneficial to be able to link from differences to the relevent migration guide so that users A) understand the change, esp significant changes like new operator, installing tracing and Kiali separately, gateways, etc.

= Explicitly create OpenShift Routes
//In the ocp-docs repo, there is no attribute for OpenShift Container Platform Ingress Operator so followed https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/networking/ingress-operator.html
An OpenShift `Route` resource allows an application to be exposed with a public URL using {ocp-product-title} Ingress Operator for managing HAProxy based Ingress controllers.

{SMProductName} 2 used Istio OpenShift Routing (IOR) that automatically created and managed OpenShift routes for Istio gateways. While this was convenient, as the Operator managed these routes for you, it also caused confusion around ownership as many `Route` resources are managed by administrators. Istio OpenShift Routing also lacked the ability to configure an independent `Route` resource, created unnecessary routes, and exhibited unpredictable behavior during updates.

Thus, in {SMProduct} 3, when a `Route` is desired to expose an Istio gateway, you must create and manage it manually. You can also expose an Istio gateway through a Kubernetes service of type `LoadBalancer` if a route is not desired.
