// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * service-mesh-docs-main/about/ossm-migrating-assembly.adoc

//Start of an overall Migrating section.
//Section is most likely to be reworked/restructured with OSSM 2 to OSSM 3 migration guides for GA. Unknown how many migration guides there are at this time (11/11/2024). It would be beneficial to be able to link from differences to the relevent migration guide so that users A) understand the change, esp significant changes like new operator, installing tracing and Kiali separately, gateways, etc.

= Kubernetes network policy management

By default, {SMProductName} 2 created Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` resources with the following behavior:

* Ensured network applications and the control plane could communicate with each other.
* Restricted ingress for mesh applications to only member projects.

{SMProduct} 3 does not create these policies. Instead, you must configure the level of isolation required for your environment. Istio provides fine grained access control of service mesh workloads through Authorization Policies. For more information, see "Authorization Policies".
