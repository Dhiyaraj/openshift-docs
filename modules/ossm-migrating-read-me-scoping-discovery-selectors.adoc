//Section is most likely to be reworked/restructured with OSSM 2 to OSSM 3 migration guides for GA. Unknown how many migration guides there are at this time (11/11/2024). It would be beneficial to be able to link from differences to the relevent migration guide so that users A) understand the change, esp significant changes like new operator, installing tracing and Kiali separately, gateways, etc.

= Scoping of the mesh with discoverySelectors and labels

In {SMProduct} 2.4, a _cluster-wide_ mode was introduced to allow a mesh to be cluster-scoped, with the option to limit the mesh using an Istio feature called `discoverySelectors`. Using `discoverySelectors` limits the Istio control plane's visibility to a set of namespaces defined with a label selector. This aligned with how community Istio worked, and allowed Istio to manage cluster-level resources. For more information, see "Labels and Selectors".

{SMProduct} 3 makes all meshes cluster-wide by default. This change means that Istio control planes are all cluster-scoped resources and the resources `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` and `ServiceMeshMember` are no longer present, with control planes watching, or _discovering_, the entire cluster by default. The control plane's discovery of namespaces can be limited using the `discoverySelectors` feature.
