// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * service-mesh-docs-main/about/ossm-migrating-assembly.adoc

//Start of an overall Migrating section.
//Section is most likely to be reworked/restructured with OSSM 2 to OSSM 3 migration guides for GA. Unknown how many migration guides there are at this time (11/11/2024). It would be beneficial to be able to link from differences to the relevent migration guide so that users A) understand the change, esp significant changes like new operator, installing tracing and Kiali separately, gateways, etc.

//table for supported commands may need to be included in prod doc instructions for Istioctl, if Istioctl procedure content is to be included in prod docs. As of 11/11/2024, there is no additional prod doc content for Istioctl. It is upstream https://github.com/openshift-service-mesh/sail-operator/blob/55e26da369c897583a578b6a622b70c9ff67beb9/docs/ossm/istioctl/README.md#supported-commands but that may change for GA.

Installation and management of Istio is only supported by the {SMProduct} 3 Operator.
