//Start of an overall Migrating section.
//Section is most likely to be reworked/restructured with OSSM 2 to OSSM 3 migration guides for GA. Unknown how many migration guides there are at this time (11/11/2024). It would be beneficial to be able to link from differences to the relevent migration guide so that users A) understand the change, esp significant changes like new operator, installing tracing and Kiali separately, gateways, etc.

= Support for multiple control planes

{SMProductName} 3 supports multiple service meshes in the same cluster, but in a different manner than in {SMProduct} 2. A cluster administrator must create multiple `Istio` instances and then configure `discoverySelectors` appropriately to ensure that there is no overlap between mesh namespaces.

As `Istio` resources are cluster-scoped, they must have unique names to represent unique meshes within the same cluster. The {SMProduct} 3 Operator uses this unique name to create a resource called `IstioRevision` with a name in the format of `{Istio name}` or `{Istio name}-{Istio version}`.

Each instance of `IstioRevision` is responsible for managing a single control plane. Workloads are assigned to a specific control plane using Istio's revision labels of the format `istio.io/rev={IstioRevision name}`. The name with the version identifier becomes important to support canary-style control plane upgrades.
