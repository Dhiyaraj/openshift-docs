//Start of an overall Migrating section.
//Section is most likely to be reworked/restructured with OSSM 2 to OSSM 3 migration guides for GA. Unknown how many migration guides there are at this time (11/11/2024). It would be beneficial to be able to link from differences to the relevent migration guide so that users A) understand the change, esp significant changes like new operator, installing tracing and Kiali separately, gateways, etc.

= Supported multi-cluster topologies

{SMProductName} 2 supported one form of multi-cluster, _federation_, which was introduced in {SMProduct} 2.1. Each cluster maintained its own independent control plane in this topology, with services only shared between those meshes on an as-needed basis.

Communication between federated meshes is through Istio gateways, so there was no need for Service Mesh control planes to watch remote Kubernetes control planes, as is the case with Istio's multi-cluster service mesh topologies. Federation is ideal where service meshes are loosely coupled, such as those managed by different administrative teams.

{SMProduct} 3 introduces support for the following Istio multi-cluster topologies as well:

* Multi-Primary
* Primary-Remote
* External control planes

These topologies effectively stretch a single, unified service mesh across multiple clusters, which is ideal when all clusters involved are managed by the same administrative team. Istio's multi-cluster topologies are also ideal for implementing high-availability or failover use cases across a commonly managed set of applications.

//Note that this section may need to be updated when federation is supported in OSSM 3. As of 11/12/2024: federation topology is not supported in OSSM 3.
