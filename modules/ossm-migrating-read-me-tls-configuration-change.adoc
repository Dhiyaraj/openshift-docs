//Start of an overall Migrating section.
//Section is most likely to be reworked/restructured with OSSM 2 to OSSM 3 migration guides for GA. Unknown how many migration guides there are at this time (11/11/2024). It would be beneficial to be able to link from differences to the relevent migration guide so that users A) understand the change, esp significant changes like new operator, installing tracing and Kiali separately, gateways, etc.

= Transport layer security (TLS) configuration change

In {SMProductName} 2, you created the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, and enabled mTLS strict mode by setting `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls` to `true`.

You were able to set the minimum and maximum TLS protocol versions by setting the `spec.security.controlPlane.tls.minProtocolVersion` or `spec.security.controlPlane.tls.maxProtocolVersion` in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

In {SMProduct} 3, the `Istio` resource replaces the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource and does not include these settings.

To enable enable mTLS strict mode in {SMProduct} 3, you must apply the corresponding `PeerAuthentication` and `DestinationRule` resources.

In {SMProduct} 3, you can enable the minimum TLS protocol by setting `spec.meshConfig.tlsDefaults.minProtocolVersion` in your `Istio` resource.  For more information, see "Istio Workload Minimum TLS Version Configuration".

In {SMProduct} 2 and {SMProduct} 3, `auto mTLS` remains enabled by default.
