= Using multiple control planes on a single cluster

You can use discovery selectors to limit the visibility of an {istio} control plane to specific namespaces in a cluster. By combining discovery selectors with control plane revisions, you can deploy multiple control planes in a single cluster, ensuring that each control plane manages only its assigned namespaces. This approach avoids conflicts between control planes and enables soft multi-tenancy for service meshes.
