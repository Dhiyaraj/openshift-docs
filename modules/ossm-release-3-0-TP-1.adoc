= {SMProductName} 3.0 Technology Preview

This release of {SMProductName} is Technology Preview.

// Simple table to help clarify for users the component versions they can use with OSSM 3.0 TP1. Likely a more complicated table will be needed for GA. OSSM 3.0 separates all the Operators such as OCP, Istio, Envoy, Kiali, OTEL/Tempo, etc. This is only what is known to work with OSSM 3.0 TP1 and TP2, as of 12/09/2024.

[id="ossm-release-3-0-TP1-component-versions-2_{context}"]
== Supported component versions for Technology Preview 2

|===
|Component |Version

|{ocp-product-title}
|4.14 and later

|Istio
|1.24.1

|Envoy Proxy
|1.32

|Kiali Operator
|2.1

|Kiali Server
|2.1
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
* You need to remove the Kiali custom resources (CR) from Technology Preview 1 before you update to {KialiProduct} 2.1.

* {KialiProduct} 2.1 is available in the `candidates` channel.
+
The `candidate` channel offers unsupported early access to releases as soon as they are built. Releases present only in candidate channels might not contain the full feature set of eventual GA releases, or features might be removed before GA. Additionally, these releases have not been subject to full Red{nbsp}Hat Quality Assurance and might not offer update paths to later GA releases. Given these caveats, the candidate channel is suitable only for testing purposes where deleting and re-creating a cluster is acceptable.

// 12/10/2024: TP2 content from this file will need to be moved to its own file set for the stand alone format prior to GA in order to keep versioning dropdown options consistent. All notes will be removed for GA.

// 12/09/2024: Per Dev, IBM Power速 and IBM Z速 platforms are not supported on TP2, only TP1. No new doc branch, so had to add new section, and update titles to denote TP1 vs TP2 unsupported features and unavailable clusters.

// 12/02/2024: Per PM, no TP2 doc branch. Just update existing file to remove "IBM Power速 and IBM Z速 platforms" from "Unsupported features" and remove "Clusters with Service Mesh 2.x" from "Unavailable clusters".

// 09/12/2024: IBM Power and 390x platforms added to unavailable features per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-8068

// 08/22/2024: Possible more items may be added in the next week.
// Per Jira description from PM: "A bare bones release notes page to capture known features that are not currently available. As nothing is technically supported yet, "unsupported" doesn't really carry weight and the focus will be on features that are either unavailable of have not been tested yet in any manner."
// TP1 content. TP banner is persistent and was handled by a different PR from Tim O'Keefe. See https://docs.openshift.com/service-mesh/3.0.0tp1/about/ossm-about-openshift-service-mesh.html
// Possible file name may change
// Possible assembly file may change
// Assemblies, topic map info needs to be worked out still for 3.0.
// Noting for future reference: Rel notes for GA will have new features, bug fixes, etc. in addition to a Component table. Component table may be its own file as there are more components to update, including supported OCP versions since stand alone format removes the connection to the OCP version. Service Mesh docs are versioned now instead of OCP docs since stand alone moves Service Mesh docs up a level.
