= Verifying multiple control planes

Verify that both of the {istio} control planes are deployed and running properly. You can validate that the `istiod` pod is successfully running in each {istio} system namespace.

. Verify that the workloads are assigned to the control plane in `istio-system-1` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n istio-system-1

.Example output
[source,terminal]
