= About {product-title}

While all editions of Red Hat OpenShift include link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/virtualization[{virt}], {product-title} is a cost-effective, virtualization-only option that does not include container-based or cloud-native features for applications. If you migrate from a traditional virtualization platform to {product-title}, you can add containerization and modernization features later by switching to a different edition of Red Hat OpenShift.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} supports hosting infrastructure services in containers. For more information, see the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/self-managed-openshift-subscription-guide[Self-managed Red Hat OpenShift subscription guide].
