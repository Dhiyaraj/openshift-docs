= Configuring the progress deadline

You can configure progress deadline settings to specify the maximum time allowed for your deployment to progress before the system reports a failure for the Knative Revision. This time limit can be specified in seconds or minutes.

To configure the progress deadline effectively, consider the following parameters:

 * `initialDelaySeconds`
 * `failureThreshold` 
 * `periodSeconds`
 * `timeoutSeconds`

If the initial scale is not achieved within the specified time limit, the Knative Autoscaler component scales the revision to `0`, and the Knative service enters a terminal `Failed` state.

By default, the progress deadline is set to 600 seconds. This value is specified as a Golang `time.Duration` string and must be rounded to the nearest second.

.Procedure

* To configure the progress deadline setting, use an annotation in your deployment configuration.
