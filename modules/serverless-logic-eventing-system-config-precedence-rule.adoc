= Eventing system configuration precedence rules

The {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} follows a defined order of precedence to determine the eventing system configuration for a workflow. 

Eventing system configuration precedence rules are as follows:

1. If the workflow has a defined eventing system by using either workflow-scoped outgoing or incoming eventing system configurations, the choice of configuration takes priority over the other configuration and applies to the workflow.

2. If the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR enclosing the workflow has a platform-scoped eventing system configured, this configuration is then applied to the next step.

3. If the current cluster is configured with a cluster-scoped eventing system, it is applied if no workflow-scoped or platform-scoped configuration exists.

4. Review the following information, if none of the above configurations are defined:

* The workflow uses direct HTTP calls to deliver SonataFlow system events to supporting services.
* The workflow consumes incoming events by HTTP POST calls at the workflow service root path `/`.
* No eventing system is configured to produce workflow business events. Any attempt to produce such events might result in a failure.
