= Installing the {ServerlessLogicProductName} Knative Workflow plugin for Linux

If you are using a Linux distribution that does not have RPM or another package manager installed, you can install the Knative Workflow plugin as a binary file.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the Knative (`kn`) command-line interface (CLI). For more information, see the xref:../install/installing-kn.adoc#installing-kn[Installing the Knative CLI] documentation.

* If you are not using {op-system-base} or Fedora, ensure that the *libc* library is installed in a directory on your path.

If the *libc* library is not available, you might see the following error when you run commands:

$ tar xvzf <tar_archive>
----

. Rename the extracted Knative Workflow plugin binary file to `kn-workflow` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mv <filename> kn-workflow

[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod +x <path/to/downloaded/kn-workflow>
----

.. Move the `kn-workflow` binary file to the `/usr/local/bin`, or a directory on your `PATH` by running the following command:

$ mv <path/to/downloaded/kn-workflow> /usr/local/bin/kn-workflow
