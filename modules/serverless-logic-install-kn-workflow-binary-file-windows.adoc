If you are using Windows, you can install the Knative Workflow plugin as a binary file.

$ Expand-Archive -Path <filename>.zip -DestinationPath <destination>
----

. Rename the extracted Knative Workflow plugin binary file to `kn-workflow` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ Rename-Item -Path <destination>\<filename>.exe -NewName kn-workflow.exe

[source,terminal]
----
$ Copy-Item -Path <destination>\kn-workflow.exe -Destination "C:\Program Files\kn-workflow.exe"
