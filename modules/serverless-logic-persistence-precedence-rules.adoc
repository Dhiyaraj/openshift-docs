= Persistence configuration precedence rules

You can use `SonataFlow` custom resource (CR) persistence independently or alongside `SonataFlowPlatform` CR persistence. If a `SonataFlowPlatform` CR persistence configuration exists in the current namespace, the following rules determine which persistence configuration applies:

1. If the `SonataFlow` CR includes a persistence configuration, that configuration takes precedence and applies to the workflow.

2. If the `SonataFlow` CR does not include a persistence configuration and the `spec.persistence` field is absent, the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} uses the persistence configuration from the current `SonataFlowPlatform` if any.

3. To disable persistence for the workflow, explicitly set `spec.persistence: {}` in the `SonataFlow` CR. This configuration ensures the workflow does not inherit persistence settings from the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR.
