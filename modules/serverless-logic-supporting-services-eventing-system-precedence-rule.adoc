= Eventing system configuration precedence rules for supporting services

The {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} follows a defined order of precedence to configure the eventing system for a supporting service. 

Eventing system configuration precedence rules are as follows:

1. If the supporting service has its own eventing system configuration, using either the Data Index eventing system or the Job Service eventing system configuration, then supporting service configuration takes precedence.

2. If the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR enclosing the supporting service is configured with a platform-scoped eventing system, that configuration takes precedence.

3. If the current cluster is configured with a cluster-scoped eventing system, that configuration takes precedence.

4. f none of the previous configurations exist, the supporting service delivers events by direct HTTP calls.
