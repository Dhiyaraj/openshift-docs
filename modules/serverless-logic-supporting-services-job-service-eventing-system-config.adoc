= Job Service eventing system configuration

To configure a service-scoped eventing system for the Job Service, you must use the `spec.services.jobService.source.ref` and `spec.services.jobService.sink.ref` fields in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR. These fields instruct the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} to automatically link the Job Service to consume and produce SonataFlow system events, based on the provided configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In production environments, use a production-ready broker, such as the Knative Kafka Broker, for enhanced scalability and reliability.

<1> Specifies the Knative Eventing Broker from which the Job Service consumes events.
<2> Optional: Defines the namespace of the Knative Eventing Broker. If you do not specify a value, the parameter defaults to the `SonataFlowPlatform` namespace. Consider creating the Broker in the same namespace as `SonataFlowPlatform`.
<3> Specifies the Knative Eventing Broker on which the Job Service produces events.
<4> Optional: Defines the namespace of the Knative Eventing Broker. If you do not specify a value, the parameter defaults to the `SonataFlowPlatform` namespace. Consider creating the Broker in the same namespace as `SonataFlowPlatform`.
