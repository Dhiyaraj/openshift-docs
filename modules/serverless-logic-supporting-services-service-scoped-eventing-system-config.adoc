= Service-scoped eventing system configuration

A service-scoped eventing system configuration allows for fine-grained control over the eventing system, specifically for the Data Index or the Job Service.

[NOTE]
====
For a {ServerlessLogicProductName} installation, consider using a platform-scoped eventing system configuration. The service-scoped configuration is intended for advanced use cases only.
