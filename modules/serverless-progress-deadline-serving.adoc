= Progress deadline

By default, services have a progress deadline that defines the time limit for a service to complete its initial startup. When using startup probes, ensure that the progress deadline is set to exceed the maximum time required by the startup probes. If the progress deadline is set too low, the startup probes might not finish before the deadline is reached, which can prevent the service from starting.

Consider increasing the progress deadline if you encounter any of these conditions in your deployment:

* The service image takes a long time to pull due to its size.
* The service takes a long time to become `READY` because of initial cache priming.
* The cluster relies on autoscaling to allocate resources for new pods.
