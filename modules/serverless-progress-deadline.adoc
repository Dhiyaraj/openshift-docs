= Progress deadline

By default, services have a progress deadline that defines the time limit for a service to complete its initial startup.

Consider increasing the progress deadline if you encounter any of these conditions in your deployment:

* The service image takes a long time to pull due to its size.
* The service takes a long time to become `READY` because of initial cache priming.
* The cluster relies on autoscaling to allocate resources for new pods.

If the initial scale is not achieved within the specified time limit, the Knative Autoscaler component scales the revision to `0`, and the service enters a terminal `Failed` state.
