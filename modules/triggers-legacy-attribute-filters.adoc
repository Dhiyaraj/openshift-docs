= Legacy attributes filter

The legacy attributes filter enables exact match filtering on any number of CloudEvents attributes, including extensions. Its functionality mirrors the exact filter dialect, and you are encouraged to transition to the exact filter whenever possible. However, for backward compatibility, the attributes filter remains available.

The following example displays how to filter events from the default broker that match the `type` attribute `dev.knative.foo.bar` and have the extension `myextension` with the `my-extension-value` value:

.Example of filtering events with specific attributes
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: my-service-trigger
spec:
  broker: default
  filter:
    attributes:
      type: dev.knative.foo.bar
      myextension: my-extension-value
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: my-service
----

When both the `filters` field and the legacy `filter` field are specified, the `filters` field takes precedence. 

For example, in the following example configuration, events with the `dev.knative.a` type are delivered, while events with the `dev.knative.b` type are ignored:
