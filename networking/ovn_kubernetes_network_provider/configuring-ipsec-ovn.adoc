With IPsec enabled, all pod-to-pod network traffic between nodes on the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network is encrypted with IPsec _Transport mode_.

IPsec is disabled by default. It can be enabled either during or after installing the cluster. For information about cluster installation, see xref:../../installing/overview/index.adoc#ocp-installation-overview[{product-title} installation overview]. If you need to enable IPsec after cluster installation, you must first resize your cluster MTU to account for the overhead of the IPsec ESP IP header.

The following support limitations exist for IPsec on a {product-title} cluster:

* You must disable IPsec before updating to {product-title} 4.15. After disabling IPsec, you must also delete the associated IPsec daemonsets. There is a known issue that can cause interruptions in pod-to-pod communication if you update without disabling IPsec. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43323[*OCPBUGS-43323*])

The following documentation describes how to enable and disable IPSec after cluster installation.

[id="{context}-prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

* You have decreased the size of the cluster MTU by `46` bytes to allow for the additional overhead of the IPsec ESP header. For more information on resizing the MTU that your cluster uses, see xref:../../networking/changing-cluster-network-mtu.adoc#changing-cluster-network-mtu[Changing the MTU for the cluster network].
