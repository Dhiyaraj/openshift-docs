toc::[]

Argo CD hides sensitive annotation values on `Secret` resources from the Argo CD user interface (UI) and command-line interface (CLI). Users can configure this by specifying annotation keys to be masked in the Argo CD custom resource (CR). This feature enhances security by preventing accidental exposure of sensitive information, such as tokens or API keys, stored in annotations on `Secret` resources.

To enable this feature, add the `resource.sensitive.mask.annotations` key under `.spec.extraConfig` in the Argo CD CR. Specify a comma-separated list of annotation keys to mask.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the annotation keys listed in `resource.sensitive.mask.annotations` are accurate and relevant to your use case. This feature does not support wildcards and requires explicit configuration in the Argo CD CR.
