You can set up the eventing system for a `SonataFlow` workflow.

In a {ServerlessLogicProductName} installation, the following types of events are generated:

* Outgoing and incoming events related to workflow business logic.
* Events sent from workflows to the Data Index and Job Service.
* Events sent from the Job Service to the Data Index Service.

The {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} leverages the Knative Eventing system to manage all event communication between these services, ensuring efficient and reliable event handling.
