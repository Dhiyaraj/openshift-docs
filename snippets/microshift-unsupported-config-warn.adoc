[WARNING]
====
Keeping component versions in a supported configuration of {op-system-bundle} can require updating {microshift-short} and {op-system-base} at the same time. Ensure that your version of {op-system-base} is compatible with the version of {microshift-short} you are updating to, especially if you are updating {microshift-short} across two minor versions. Otherwise, you can create an unsupported configuration, break your cluster, or both. For more information, see the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_microshift/4.15/html/installing/microshift-install-rpm#install-rpm-rhde-compatibility-table[Red Hat Device Edge release compatibility matrix].
