As a cluster administrator, you can use the Shared Resource Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver in any Kubernetes object that uses the volume type as `csi` to provision inline ephemeral volumes that contain the contents of `Secret` or `ConfigMap` objects. This way, pods and other Kubernetes types that expose volume mounts, and {ocp-product-title} Builds can securely use the contents of those objects across potentially any namespace in the cluster. To accomplish this, there are currently two types of shared resources: 

* `SharedSecret` custom resource for `Secret` objects
* `SharedConfigMap` custom resource for `ConfigMap` objects
